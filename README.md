## Vision
The goal of this project is to create an accessible web application that can predict and possibly identify the disease that a patient might have based on the symptoms that the patient chronicles. 
Analogous to Google, as the user enters symptoms, the application draws possible diseases and illnesses with similar symptom profiles from a database. As the symptom list grows and gets more specific, 
the application gets more accurate. The dataset table will provide multiple diseases with symptoms already listed. Although the website can provide all these predictions of what the patient could have, 
it will not compare to an actual medical professional or primary doctor.
